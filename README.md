TACTICS OF VISIBILITY

A helmet able to automatically detect surveillance cameras was created. It indicates to its users when they are being filmed. This device reveals and enhances cameras which are each time more discreet and camouflaged in the cities.
The device also contains a GPS and when it detects a camera, its coordinates are registered and saved on a map (see below), automatically mapping a given route.


TACTICS OF INVISIBILITY â€“ IN PROCESS

A route designer is in development which is able to create routes from point A to point B, in a city, walking only by the blind spots of its cameras.
Here  a first prototype  of the invisibility route tracer.
